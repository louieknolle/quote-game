#### By: Ryan Broadsword, Nick Tse, Louie Knolle, Viktoria Zubarieva

## Description

This project is a quiz which is called "Quote Game". A user can choose two diffrent game modes like "Movie Quotes" - where the quotes will be from movies or TV shows and they need to guess who said it. Another mode is "Random quotes" - where there will be famous quotes. The user will need to answer the questions by selecting the radio button next to the person or character name and hit submit. In the end user can see how well he/she goes through the quiz and how many answers were right. Also, the player will have a chance to get on to the leaderboard which displays the top 3 players with the highest scores.
